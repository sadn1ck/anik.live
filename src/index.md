# Hi, I'm Anik 👋

I am a student developer and aspiring software engineer currently in my pre-final year of college.

I work mostly in Typescript, Javascript, Vue 2/3 and some React and do problem solving in Python from time to time.

I also enjoy DevOps, having set up CI/CD pipelines with Docker, Bash and GitHub Actions. I have worked in NestJS in the backend along with some experimental dabbling in WebSockets.

I'm currently looking for Internship Opportunities for the Summer of 2022. If you have any opportunities, questions or just want to chat regarding tech, feel free to email me!
