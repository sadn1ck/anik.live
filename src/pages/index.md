# Hi, I'm Anik ðŸ‘‹

I am a developer from Kolkata, West Bengal. I love creating things people will use daily and it inspires me to learn more. I am always curious to know more about technologies and spend my time tinkering and reading about them.

I work mostly in Typescript, Javascript, Vue 2/3 and some React and do problem solving in Python from time to time. I also enjoy DevOps, having set up CI/CD pipelines with Docker, Bash and GitHub Actions. I have worked in NestJS in the backend along with some experimental dabbling in WebSockets.
