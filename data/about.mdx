## About myself

I work mostly in Typescript, Javascript, Vue 2/3, React (learning Next.js currently) and like exploring the current Frontend landscape.

I also enjoy DevOps, having set up CI/CD pipelines with Docker, Bash and GitHub Actions. I have worked in NestJS in the backend along with some experimental dabbling in WebSockets.

I'm currently looking for SWE/SDE Internship Opportunities for the Summer of 2022. If you have a position for an eager and motivated developer, please reach out to me!
